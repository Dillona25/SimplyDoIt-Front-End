# Simply Do It

Its simple, Simply Do It is a mobile only full-stack application in which allows users to plan their day, or even week. The applications allows users to add tasks, edit tasks, delete tasks, and of course mark them as complete. The user can also edit their profile information.
<br>
The application was created using React.js, Tailwind CSS, framer motion, and many other react dependencies to make for a slick user experience.
<br>
I am currently working on a back-end for the application that will be programmed using Node.js, express.js and MongoDb.
